TASK.md
Initial Tasks
1. Set Up Development Environment

Install Python and necessary packages (langchain, chromadb, openai, streamlit, Pillow for image handling, etc.).
Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
Initialize a Git repository for version control.
Configure API keys for OpenAI (and any other required services).

2. Data Collection and Preparation

Collect product data, including product name, descriptions, prices, categories, images, and URLs.
Preprocess text data (e.g., clean descriptions, handle missing values).
Organize image data and ensure images are accessible (e.g., stored locally or via URLs).
Validate the quality and consistency of the data.

3. Embedding Generation

Text Embeddings: Use OpenAI Embeddings (or Sentence Transformers) to generate embeddings for product descriptions.
Image Embeddings: Use OpenAI CLIP (or a similar model) to generate embeddings for product images.
Implement batch processing to handle large datasets efficiently.

4. Vector Database Setup

Install and configure ChromaDB locally or via a cloud instance.
Create separate collections for text and image embeddings.
Define metadata schemas to store product details (description, price, image URL, product link).
Upload text and image embeddings to their respective collections in ChromaDB.

5. Retrieval System Development

Implement text-based retrieval: Embed user text queries and retrieve relevant products from the text embedding collection.
Implement image-based retrieval: Embed uploaded images and retrieve similar products from the image embedding collection.
Develop a combined retrieval mechanism for queries with both text and image inputs (e.g., weighted similarity search).

6. LLM Integration for Generation

Set up OpenAI GPT-4o for generating responses based on retrieved product data.
Configure the model to handle multimodal inputs (text and images) for more accurate and context-aware responses.
Test basic query responses to ensure the model integrates correctly with the retrieval system.

7. User Interface Development

Use Streamlit to create an interactive chatbot interface.
Implement input fields for text queries and image uploads.
Display responses that include product descriptions, prices, images, and hyperlinks.
Ensure the interface is user-friendly and responsive.

8. Testing and Refinement

Test the retrieval accuracy for text, image, and combined queries.
Validate the relevance and coherence of the generated responses.
Debug any integration issues between components (e.g., embedding mismatches, API errors).
Refine the system based on test results and user feedback.

Next Steps

Explore advanced multimodal features, such as fine-tuning embeddings for better accuracy.
Implement real-time data updates to keep product information current.
Schedule regular maintenance and data refreshes to ensure the system remains up-to-date.
