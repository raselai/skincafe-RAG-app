## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/raselai/skincafe-RAG-app.git
cd skincafe-RAG-app
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

1. Start the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run rag.py
```

## Project Structure

- `rag.py`: Main Streamlit application with RAG implementation
- `data/skincafe_products.json`: Product database with SkinCafe products
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `.env`: Environment variables (not tracked in git)
- `TASK.md`: Project task breakdown
- `PLANNING.md`: Project planning and architecture

## How It Works

1. The application uses FAISS vector database to store product embeddings
2. Text queries are processed using OpenAI's embeddings
3. The RAG system combines retrieved information with GPT-4 to generate responses
4. Responses include product images, prices, and detailed information
5. Chat history is maintained for contextual conversations
