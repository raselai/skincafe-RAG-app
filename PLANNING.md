Project Overview
The goal is to develop a multimodal RAG system for an e-commerce platform that enhances customer service by responding to both text and image queries. The system will retrieve relevant product information (descriptions, prices, images, and links) from a vector database and generate contextually accurate responses. It will support multimodal inputs (text and images) and outputs (text, images, and hyperlinks), making it a versatile tool for customer interactions.
Technology Stack

Vector Database: ChromaDB – A lightweight, open-source vector database for storing and retrieving text and image embeddings.
Embedding Models:
Text Embeddings: OpenAI Embeddings (or Sentence Transformers) for product descriptions.
Image Embeddings: OpenAI CLIP (or similar) for generating embeddings from product images.


Large Language Model (LLM): OpenAI GPT-4o – A multimodal model capable of processing both text and images for generation and understanding.
Orchestration Framework: LangChain – For managing the RAG pipeline, including retrieval and generation.
User Interface: Streamlit – A Python framework for building an interactive chatbot interface.

Data Sources

Product Catalogs: Structured data including product name, prices, categories, images, descriptions, and URLs.
Customer Reviews (Optional): Unstructured data for additional context or sentiment analysis.
Image Data: Product images to be embedded and retrieved based on user queries.

System Architecture

Data Ingestion: Collect and preprocess product data (text and images).
Embedding Generation:
Generate text embeddings for product descriptions.
Generate image embeddings for product images using a vision model (e.g., CLIP).


Vector Storage: Store text and image embeddings in ChromaDB, with metadata linking to product details ( name, description, price, image URL, product link).
Retrieval:
For text queries: Embed the query and retrieve relevant products from the text embedding collection.
For image queries: Embed the uploaded image and retrieve similar products from the image embedding collection.
For combined queries (text + image): Retrieve based on both modalities and combine results.


Generation: Use GPT-4o to generate a response based on the retrieved product data, incorporating both text and image context.
Output Formatting: Present the response in Streamlit, including the product description, price, image, and a hyperlink to the product page.

Multimodal Capabilities

Input: 
Text queries (e.g., "Facewash").
Image uploads (e.g., a picture of a product to find similar items).
Combined text and image inputs for more refined queries.


Output:
Textual product description and price.
Product image.
Hyperlink to the product page.
